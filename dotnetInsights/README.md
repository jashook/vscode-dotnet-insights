# .NET Insights

An extension for drilling into .NET MSIL and Jitted ASM for managed executables (PE Files). This is a cross platform extension that works on Linux (Ubuntu) OSX and Windows x64.

Future work to include Windows arm64 and Linux arm64. Currently 32-bit support is not expected to be worked on; however, feel free to contribute.

Note that currently only x64 assembly will be generated. Future support will come around for cross architectures like arm64, arm and x86.

In addition to inspection into Managed PE Files, the extension allows performance monitoring of .NET applications currently running on the machine. The extension will use TraceEvent to connect to all .NET Core applications 3.x+ to receive GC allocation, start and stop events. It will then compile the information per heap and display it by process.

# Issues

There are known issues with the extension. See [Bugs](https://github.com/jashook/vscode-dotnet-insights/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug) for more information.

1. [PMI is slow to dump ASM for large files](https://github.com/jashook/vscode-dotnet-insights/issues/18)
2. [Older versions of the extension are not cleaned up on newer install](https://github.com/jashook/vscode-dotnet-insights/issues/19)

# Overview

## GC Monitoring Usage

1. `ctrl (cmd) + shift + p` to get to enter a command
2. Start GC Monitoring

At this point you have started a background server which will monitor and communicate back to the .NET Insights extension. **This is expensive both for VScode and ALL running .NET Applications on the machine.** 

### **After monitoring the Stop GC Monitoring Command via ctrl (cmd) + shift + p!**

Navigate to the `---` icon on the activity bar. Each managed .NET Core process which has GCs will propogate in this view.

When a process is selected a custom view will come up with the GC Statistics for the process during the monitor window. *Please remember that the GCs display are **only** post the monitor command, and pre the stop monitoring command. This is defined to be the monitoring window.* While selected, real time information about GCs will continue to update in realtime.

## IL Introspection Usage

### Show IL/Dasm on save

**C# Extension is required**.

From C# source file right click `Show IL/Asm on save`. From this point on each time the file is saved the IL will be shown along with the JITed code to the right. Note that this works by compiling the current file. There are current drawbacks that keep the compilation from succeeding with files that either reference other files or other projects/packages.

There is hopeful work to fix this in the future. To stop generating the IL/Dasm on save you can run the command: `>Stop generating IL/Asm on save` via `<ctrl/cmd><shift><p>`.

### Inspect PE File

1. Select a managed PE file. This is generally a .NET DLL under the `${workspaceFolder}/bin/Release/application.dll`
2. By default the .NET MSIL will be dumped and opened. Once this is done, the IL+ view on the side will have a list of types and methods for the DLL.
3. Click on a method to dump the Optimized ASM generated by the .NET Jit. Optionally right click to dump either the .NET Tier 0 Jitted code or diff Tier 0/Tier 1.

## Notes

Dumping the ASM for a Debug built DLL will **always** dump debuggable code (Tier 0).

The first startup of the extension will download two private builds of the .NET runtime 3.1 and 5.0. This is expected to take ~5 minutes to setup.

## Future planned work

1. [Add thread metrics](https://github.com/jashook/vscode-dotnet-insights/issues/20)
2. [Add JIT Metrics](https://github.com/jashook/vscode-dotnet-insights/issues/21)
